# Bulk-QR-Generator-Using-Python

> [!IMPORTANT]
>To create a bulk QR code generator using Python, i used the qrcode library to generate QR codes and the PIL (Pillow) library to save them as images. First, you need to install these libraries if you haven't already:

 `pip install qrcode[pil]`

>[!NOTE]
>when you run the script, it will prompt you to enter a comma-separated list of strings. After entering the strings and pressing Enter, it will generate QR codes for each string and save them to the specified folder in a zip file. Adjust the folder name and file name as needed.
